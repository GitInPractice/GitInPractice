## GitHub pull requests
ifdef::env-github[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

GitHub provides more than just Git hosting that you can `git push` to and `git fetch` from; it also provides features that allow teams of individuals to collaborate on software projects in ways beyond those provided by Git itself.

Two of these features are _pull requests_ and _forks_. In this chapter you'll learn about GitHub's pull requests by learning about the following topics:

* How to make pull requests from branches on the same repository
* How to make pull requests from branches a forked repository
* How to interact with forks and pull requests from the command-line
* How to merge a pull request from a forked repository

### What are pull requests and forks?
One of the core components of most software project collaboration is some sort of issue (or bug) tracker, such as Jira, FogBugz, Pivotal Tracker, and Trac. GitHub provides an issue tracker for every repository known as _Issues_. In GitHub's Issues, there is a subject and body field, open or closed state, labels, and comments.

There is a special type of issue known as a _pull request_ (or _PR_). This is an issue on a project with an attached branch of code changes. Pull requests are used to request that someone with commit access to the repository merge the code changes from the pull request branch into their the main repository. Once a PR has been received, you can view the changes that have been requested and anyone who can view the PR can make comments either inline on the commit or generally on the PR. If there are comments that require changes to be made then they can be committed and pushed to the pull request branch, and the pull request will be updated with these changes. Once the PR's changes have reached an acceptable standard to be included in the repository, they can be merged with the "Merge" button from the GitHub website, which will merge the requested branch into the repository.

Let's say you're creating a new web application and want the `master` branch to be regularly to the web server. You want to ensure that any branches merged into the `master` branch are always checked over by at least one other developer before they're merged (to ensure nobody accidentally deploys bad code to the server). To do this, you could request that anyone using the project creates a pull request rather than merging directly to `master` and that they receive an OK from at least one other developer before merging to `master`. If the changes aren't yet OK then someone can add more commits to the pull request and it will be merged when it has been OKd. Adopting this approach will result in higher-quality code being merged to `master` and fewer silly mistakes, as any new changes will have at least one person other than the original author checking over it.

Recall from <<02-RemoteGit#cloning-a-remote-github-repository-onto-your-local-machine-git-clone>> that we use `git clone` to initially download an entire repository. A _fork_ is similar to a clone, but rather than downloading the repository to your local machine, it creates a clone of a repository on GitHub's servers. This allows you to make any changes you wish to your _fork_ even if you don't have commit access to the original repository. Anyone with read access to a repository can fork it.

PRs and forks can be combined so you can find a repository you wish to make changes to, fork it, and make changes in your local fork. You can then create a PR to request the changes on the branch in your fork be merged into the original repository.

Let's return to the new web application example. Let's say that you have an open-source library that your web application depends on, and you've found a bug in it. You want to fix this bug and share it with the open source library maintainers so that they can provide the fix to everyone. But you've never worked on this project before and the maintainers don't know or trust you yet, so they're unlikely to give you commit access to the project so you can fix the bug. Instead you'd fork the repository, make the changes, commit and test them, and then create a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository. This would allow the maintainers of the project to review your proposed changes, make any comments, and merge them when they're ready. This provides a similar code-review workflow as when using pull requests without forks, but means that anyone can suggest changes without having the ability to merge them.

You can read more about using pull requests and forking repositories in GitHub's official help pages at https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests and https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo. I've not reproduced or rewritten them here, as they and their images are kept up-to-date with any changes made to GitHub.

### Interacting with GitHub from the command-line: gh
We've been working mostly from the command line in this book, and PRs are sometimes a core part of Git workflows, so it would be useful if we could also create PRs from the command line. Thankfully there's a tool called `gh` that allows interacting with GitHub from the command line (through the GitHub API). It's available for download and provides installation instructions at https://github.com/jingweno/gh.

The `gh` command-line tool allows various interactions with GitHub by providing a wrapper on top of Git's interface and adding new commands and improving the interaction of some Git commands with GitHub.

For example, instead of running `git clone https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/GitInPracticeRedux` you could instead just run `gh clone MikeMcQuaid/GitInPracticeRedux` to perform the same action of cloning a GitHub repository to your local machine.

The `gh` tool can also be used to create PRs from the command line. Although this accomplishes the same end result as the web interface and is slightly less flexible, I generally prefer it, as it fits in more nicely into the command-line-driven workflow of using the Git to interact with a project's repository.

### Making a pull request in the same repository: gh pull-request
In my experience, most teams that work on private repositories tend to use a single repository rather than many different forks. Pull requests can still be used on a private repository; even although everyone with read access will also have commit access, PRs are still useful for performing code review before changes are merged into a repository.

To create a PR, we need to create a local branch of the changes we want to be merged into another branch (`master`, by default), push our local branch to a remote branch, and use `gh` to create a pull request.

#### Problem
You wish to create a GitHub pull request from the command line.

#### Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository; on my system, `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Create a new branch from the `master branch` by running a command like `git checkout -b pr-test master`.
3.  Make some changes to a file--for example `00-Preface.asciidoc`--and commit them by running `git commit 00-Preface.asciidoc`. Ensure that there are multiple lines in the commit message--a commit subject and commit body.
4.  Push the local branch to a remote branch by running `git push --set-upstream origin pr-test`.
5.  Create a pull request by running `gh pull-request` and accept the default pull request message (which should match the commit message).

The output for these commands should resemble the following:

.Create pull request with `gh` output
[.long-annotations]
```
# git checkout -b pr-test master

Switched to a new branch 'pr-test' <1>

# git commit 00-Preface.asciidoc

# gh pull-request

https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/GitInPracticeRedux/pull/1 <4>
```
<1> Local branch
<2> New commit
<3> Remote branch
<4> Pull request

From the pull request creation output:

* "Local branch (1)" shows the creation of the new local branch. This will be used to commit the changes for the new pull request.
* "New commit (2)" shows the new commit on the `pr-test` branch. It was created with a commit message subject and body.
* "Remote branch (3)" shows the new remote branch that was created to be used for the new pull request.
* "Pull request (4)" shows the URL for the new pull request created by the `gh` tool using the GitHub API. It is requesting the merge of the `pr-test` branch into the remote repository's `master` branch.

You have created a new pull request from the command-line using the `gh` tool.

#### Discussion
.How do you use branches with pull requests?
NOTE: Each pull request you create should use a new, non-`master` branch. As each pull request tracks the status (and any new commits) for a particular remote branch, you need to ensure that each branch is used for a separate pull request to avoid situations like adding a new commit to one pull request and having it show up in another. You should also avoid creating pull requests from the `master` branch, as this is generally the branch you will want to merge to. Additionally, GitHub will sometimes not update the `master` branch if you push new commits to it after creating the pull request, so you'd need to create a new pull request for every change that needs to be made. This is less than ideal, as you lose all the existing context and comments.

Now that a pull request has been created you can view it in the GitHub web interface:

.New pull request
[[new-pull-request]]
image::diagrams/10-PullRequest.png[]

<<new-pull-request>> shows the new pull request that has been created on GitHub. `gh` defaulted the pull request message to that of the single commit in this pull request. You can see that the commit message subject was used for the title of the pull request and the commit message body was used as the initial comment. Additionally the `master` branch was used as the _base branch_, which is the branch that the PR requests the changes be merged into. The changes that should be merged in are those from the `pr-test` branch, which is known as the _head branch_.

Essentially the pull request has just created a remote branch named `pr-test`, which we've requested someone merge into the `master` branch and discuss any changes that need to be made.

The `gh` tool also accepts the `-b` and `-h` parameters, which can be followed with a branch name to change the base and head branches respectively. These can either be passed a branch name such as `pr-test`; a branch name and GitHub user/organization name such as `GitInPractice:pr-test`; or a GitHub user/organization name, repository name, and branch name, as in `MikeMcQuaid/GitInPracticeRedux:pr-test`.

.How can you view a pull request without whitespace changes?
NOTE: The Files Changed pane on a pull request will show a diff of the changes in that pull request. Some lines may have changes to whitespace that you don't care about. In this case, you can avoid them by appending `?w=1` to the "Files changed" URL; for example, https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/GitInPracticeRedux/pull/1/files?w=1

### Making a pull request from a forked repository: gh fork
If you want to commit to an open source software project that you don't have commit access to, you'll want to create a pull request so others can review your changes before they're merged (because open source doesn't mean letting anyone commit to any repository at any time). To do this, you'll want to create your own repository that you can make commits and push branches to and request pull requests from. As you may recall from <<what-are-pull-requests-and-forks>>, you can fork any repository you have read access to (which includes all public, open-source repositories).

#### Problem
You wish to fork a repository and create a pull request from that fork from the command line.

#### Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository; for example, `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Create a new fork by running `gh fork`.
3.  Create a new branch from the `master branch` by running a command like `git checkout -b credits master`.
4.  Make some changes to a file--for example, `01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc`--and commit them by running `git commit 01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc`. Ensure that there are multiple lines in the commit message--a commit subject and commit body.
5.  Push the local branch to a remote branch by running, for example, `git push --set-upstream origin pr-test`.
6.  Create a pull request by running `gh pull-request` and accept the default pull request message (which should match the commit message).

The output for these commands should resemble the following:

.Create fork and pull request with `gh` output

https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/GitInPracticeRedux/pull/2 <5>
```
<1> Repository fork
<2> Local branch
<3> New commit
<4> Remote branch
<5> Pull request

From the fork and pull request creation output:

* "Repository fork (1)" shows that the repository was forked on GitHub and a new remote repository was added with the username of the fork (`mikemcquaid` in this case) and fetched.
* "Local branch (2)" shows the creation of the new local branch.
* "New commit (3)" shows the new commit on the `credits` branch.
* "Remote branch (4)" shows the new remote branch that was created.
* "Pull request (5)" shows the URL for the new pull request. It's requesting the merge of the `credits` branch from the https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/GitInPracticeRedux forked repository into the `master` branch of the https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/GitInPracticeRedux main repository.

You have created a fork and pull request from it from the command line.

### Merging a pull request from the same repository
Merging a pull request from a non-forked repository is easy. You can either click the Merge Pull Request button (as seen in <<new-pull-request>>) or just merge the branch as you would any other. Note that the Merge Pull Request button always performs a non-fast-forward merge (it always produces a merge commit) so let's do that here too.

#### Problem
You wish to merge a pull request from the command line.

#### Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository; on my machine, `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Checkout the `master` branch by running `git checkout master`.
3.  Ensure that all the remote branches are up to date by running `git fetch`.
4.  Merge the remote `pr-test` branch into the `master` branch by running `git merge --no-ff origin/pr-test`.
5.  Push the updated `master` branch with `git push`.
6.  Delete the now-merged `pr-test` branch by running `git push --delete origin pr-test`.

The output for these commands should resemble the following:

.Merging a pull request
```
# git checkout master

Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'. <1>

# git fetch

# git merge --no-ff origin/pr-test

Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.

 - [deleted]         pr-test <4>
```
<1> Branch checkout
<2> Merge commit
<3> Branch push
<4> Branch delete

From the merging a pull request output:

* "Branch checkout (1)" shows the checkout of the `master` branch. This is required, because to merge into the `master` branch, you first need to have the `master` branch checked out.
* "Merge commit (2)" shows the new merge commit created by the non-fast-forward commit. Remember this was run withe `--no-ff` to guarantee creating a merge commit (which matches the behavior of the "Merge pull request" button).
* "Branch push (3)" shows the new merged commits being pushed to the remote `master` branch.
* "Branch delete (4)" shows the deletion of the now merged (and therefore unneeded) `pr-test` branch.

You have successfully merged a pull request from the command line.

#### Discussion
Let's look at the pull request on GitHub:

.Merged pull request
[[merged-pull-request]]
image::screenshots/10-MergedPullRequest.png[]

<<merged-pull-request>> shows the state of the merged pull request after these changes. You'll notice that after the push, the pull request has been automatically closed, as it has detected that you've merged the contents of the branch remotely.

.How can you close a pull request without a merge or issue from a commit?
NOTE: If you prefer to perhaps cherry-pick or rewrite some of the commits then the SHA-1 may change. This case may not be detected automatically by GitHub as a merge, and therefore the issue may not be closed automatically. If you wish to ensure that any modified commit will automatically close the pull request, you could use `git rebase --interactive` or `git commit --amend` to change the commit message for one of the commits to include text such as `Closes #1`. The first pull request that was created in our example was numbered #1. This magic string in a commit message is detected by GitHub and indicates that when this commit is merged to the `master` branch on the main repository, it should close the pull request or issue numbered #1. You can read more about this in GitHub's help at https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages.

### Merging a pull request from a forked repository: gh merge
To merge a pull request from a forked repository is more involved. You can click the Merge Pull Request button, but what if you want to merge the branch from the command line? You could manually add the forked repository as a remote repository and merge it like before. Instead, though, let's use the handy `gh` tool again to make things a bit easier.

To simulate the typical open-source maintainer approach where you wouldn't have new forks already added as remote repositories, let's start by removing the fork's remote from the local Git repository by running `git remote rm mikemcquaid` (which won't produce any output). This leaves the remote intact on GitHub, but just means that it no longer will be on the local repository.

#### Problem
You wish to merge a pull request from a forked repository from the command line.

#### Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository; for example, `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Checkout the `master` branch by running `git checkout master`.
3.  Merge the remote pull request into the `master` branch by running `gh merge https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/GitInPracticeRedux/pull/2`.
4.  Push the updated `master` branch with `git push`.

The output for these commands should resemble the following:

.Merging a pull request from a forked repository
```
# git checkout master

Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'. <1>

# gh merge https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/GitInPracticeRedux/pull/2

* "PR commit (2)" shows the new merge commit created by the pull request merge.
* "Branch push (3)" shows the new PR commits being pushed to the remote `master` branch.

You have successfully merged a pull request from a forked repository from the command line.

### Summary
In this chapter you hopefully learned:

* How pull requests are used to request the merge and review of branches
* How forks are used to request pull requests on repositories without commit access
* How to create a new pull request using `gh pull-request`
* How to merge a pull request using `git merge` or `gh merge`
