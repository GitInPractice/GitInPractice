//[DAN]: General notes regarding gitx screenshots.
//[DAN]: 1. Remember to crop out unnecessary things. Are the committer name and datetime actually necessary in any of the screenshots?
//[DAN]: 2. Consider making each screenshot a before and after shot so the reader can actually see what effect the command has ahd on the timeline. Currently you only see the after shot which doesn't really help identify what has changed.
//[DAN]: 3. Add annotations to highlight what has changed and how to interpret what we are seeing.

== Advanced Branching
You've already learnt the basics of branching in Chapter 2. In this chapter you
will learn about more advanced branching techniques by learning the following
topics:

* How to configure `git merge` to behave differently
* How to resolve merge conflicts
* How to avoid solving the same merge conflicts multiple times
* How to create a tag
* How to generate a version number from previous tags
* How to bring individual commits from one branch to another
* How to revert a previous commit
* How to list what branches contain a given commit

When working as part of a team on a software project you will typically use
branches to separate work between individuals, features, bug fixes and software
releases. You should already be able to perform some basic branching actions //[DAN]: Care to list these basic actions?
from Chapter 2. This chapter will expand on that so you can improve your
branching workflow to be more effective.

//[DAN]: It seems important enough here to re-establish what a merge commit is

Let's start by learning how to use some of the parameters provided by `git
merge`.

//[DAN]: Why change the title here from that in the bullet list in the intro? How about "Merge branches more effectively : git merge re-examined" or something wtihout the 'different options' bit. That's not a recipe name at the mo. It's like saying "Bake a cake with different fillings". The recipe is Bake a Cake and the discussion looks at the different fillings. The whole bit about fast-forwarding commits etc in the background section means either the recipe should be called "Fast-forwaridng Merges" or that it is in the wrong place or that each of these different merge techniques is just that - a different technqiue, should be marked as such and have their own background and discussions. 
=== Merge branches with different options
You learnt in Chapter 2 how to perform a basic merge of two branches. //[DAN]: Quick summary here?
Additionally, `git merge` provides various options
for merging branches without creating merge commits, using various strategies
or a graphical merge tool.  //[DAN]: Being picky here, but git merge is controlled by the tool not the other way round which si the implication in the text. Could you rephrase please? 



//[DAN]: I don't recall the concept of a fast-forwarded merge in Chapter 2.
Let's start by seeing how to perform a merge that could be fast-forwarded but
without creating a merge commit. Recall a fast-forward merge means that the
incoming branch has the current branch as an ancestor i.e. no commits have been
made on the current branch since the incoming branch branched from it.
//[DAN]: What was the point of this branch then if nothing was committed.

//[DAN]: WHy is this not here? I thought we were trying to establish the various possible options for merging. This note seems more apt if the whole discussion was on forcing the creation of a merge commit. Problem is that you haven't actually brought up the idea of forcing it.  
.Why would you want to force creation of a merge commit?
NOTE: While fast-forward merges can sometimes be useful in some Git workflows
you will want to explicitly signify the merging of a branch, even if it was not
necessary to do so. This explicit indication of a merge through the creation of
a merge commit can show all the metadata present in any other commit e.g. who
performed the merge, when and why. In software projects merging a new feature
will usually be done by merging a branch and it is useful for regression
testing and history visualization for this feature merge to be more explicit.

Let's create a branch that can be merged with a fast-forward merge:

1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git checkout -b chapter-spacing`.
3.  Edit `01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc` to add a line-break between
    chapters.
//[DAN]: No git add command?    
4.  Run `git commit --message 'Add spacing between chapters'
    01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc`.
    The output should resemble:

.Fast-forward branch commit output
----
# git commit --message 'Add spacing between chapters'
  01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc

[chapter-spacing 4426877] Add spacing between chapters
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
----

You've created a new branch named `chapter-spacing` that can be merged with a
fast-forward merge into the `master` branch.

==== Problem
//[DAN]: Having jsut set up a branch for fast-forwarding, you start with "not performing a fast-forward merge". That doesn't make a great deal of sense. 
You wish to merge the `chapter-spacing` branch into the `master` branch and
create a merge commit i.e. not perform a fast-forward merge.

==== Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git checkout master`.
3.  Run `git merge --no-ff chapter-spacing`. You will be prompted for a commit
    message but can just accept the default.
    The output should resemble:

.Forced merge commit output
----
# git merge --no-ff chapter-spacing

Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy. <1>
 01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) <2>
----
<1> merge type
<2> diff summary

You can now delete the merged `chapter-spacing` branch by running `git branch
--delete chapter-spacing` from the `master` branch.

From the forced merge commit output:

* "merge type (1)" shows that this was a merge (rather than a fast-forward) and
  therefore produced a merge commit. It used the _recursive_ Git merge strategy
  (we'll discuss strategies more in the Discussion section).
* "diff summary (2)" shows a short summary of the changes that were made in
  this merge commit i.e. all the differences between the `master` branch and
  the `chapter-spacing` branch.

You have merged the `chapter-spacing` branch into the `master` branch and
forced a merge-commit to be created.

==== Discussion
//[DAN]: Always start sections with text and not a browseable.
//[DAN]: See general notes, but also, should we be comparing the branching here with a GUI that hs just had a ff commit?
.Local repository after `git merge --no-ff chapter-spacing`
image::screenshots/05-GitXMergeNoFF.png[]

You can see from Figure 5.1 that GitX shows a merge commit differently from a
fast-forward. A merge commit has two parents: the previous commit on the
current branch (i.e. `master` in this case) and the previous commit on the
incoming branch (i.e. `chapter-spacing` in this case). Even when the
`chapter-spacing` branch was deleted the existence of the branch will remain
implied by the visual branching and merging in GitX. 
//[DAN]: But there is no sign at least in GitX of what the branch was called?    
In this case where the
branch contained a single commit this may not be terribly useful but on larger
features this explicit indication of branches can aid history visualization.

`git merge` can also take a `--ff-only` flag which ensures that a merge commit
is never created. In the case that the merge can only be made with a merge
commit (e.g. there are conflicts that need to be resolved) then it will not
perform the merge.
//[DAN]: The above paragraph just doe snot make sense to me even after rpeated reading. Can you try adn rephrase please?

===== Merge strategies
The previous merge output state that it was using the _recursive_ merge
strategy. A merge strategy is an algorithm that Git uses to decide how to
perform a merge.  //[DAN]: This definition should be in italics or better still in the background section.

Strategies can be selected by passing the `--strategy` (or `-s`) flag to `git
merge` followed by the name of the strategy. For example, to select the
default, recursive strategy you could also call `git merge
--strategy=recursive`.

Certain strategies (such as recursive) can also take options by passing the
`--strategy-option` (or `-X`) flag. For example, to set the patience diff
option for the default, recursive strategy you would call `git merge
--strategy-option=patience`.

Some useful merge strategies are:

* `recursive`: this strategy can merge one branch into another and
  automatically detect renames. This strategy is the default if you try and
  merge a single branch into another.
* `octopus`: this strategy can merge multiple branches at once but will refuse
  to allow manual resolution of merge conflicts. This strategy is the default
  if you try and merge two or more branches into another.
  //[DAN]: 3 or more branches in one merge? Really? You should have a whole section on that and not jsut a brief mention here.
* `ours`: this strategy performs a normal merge but ignores all the changes
  from the incoming branch. This means the resulting tree is the same as it
  was before the merge. This can be useful when you wish to merge a branch and
  indicate this in the history without wanting to actually including any of its
  changes. For example, you could use this to merge the results of a failed
  experiment and then delete the experimental branch afterwards. In this case
  the experiment would remain in the history without being in the current code.
* `subtree`: this strategy is a modified version of the recursive strategy that
  will detect if the tree structures are at different levels and adjust them if
  needed. For example, if one branch had all the files in the directory `A/B/C`
  and the other had all the same files in the directory `A/B` then the subtree
  strategy would handle this case; `A/B/C/README.md` and `A/B/README.md` could
  be merged despite their different tree locations.

Some useful merge strategy options for a recursive merge (currently the only
strategy with options) are:

* `ours`: this option automatically solves any merge conflicts by always
  selecting the previous version from the current branch (instead of the
  version from the incoming branch).
* `theirs`: this option is the reverse of `ours`; it automatically solves any
  merge conflicts by always selecting the version from the incoming branch
  (instead of the previous version from the current branch).
* `patience`: this option uses a slightly more expensive `git diff` algorithm
  to try and decrease the chance of a merge conflict.
* `ignore-all-space`: this option ignores whitespace when selecting which
  version should be chosen in case of a merge conflict. If the incoming branch
  has made only whitespace changes to a line the change will be ignored. If the
  current branch has introduced whitespace changes but the incoming branch has
  made non-whitespace changes then their version will be used.

Neither of these lists are exhaustive but these are the strategies and options
I've found are most commonly used. All the merge strategies and options can be
examined by running `git help merge`.

=== Resolve a merge conflict
As mentioned previously sometimes when you merge one branch into another there
will have been changes to the same part of the same file in both branches and
Git cannot detect automatically which one is the desired change to include. In
this situation you have what is known as a _merge conflict_ which you will need
to resolve manually.

These situations tend to occur more often in software projects where you have
multiple users working on the same project at the same time. One user might
make a bug fix to a file while another refactors it and when the branches are
merged then a merge conflict will be created.

Let's create a new branch and change the same files in both branches to produce
a merge conflict.
//[DAN]: Add alisting here of what the file look slike before tampering. That will help us mprehend what Listing 5.6 (the conflict) is showing us.

1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git checkout -b separate-files`.
3.  Run `git mv 01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc 00-Preface.asciidoc`
4.  Cut the "Chapter 2" section from `00-Preface.asciidoc` and paste it into a
    new file named `02-AdvancedGitInPractice.asciidoc`.
5.  Cut the "Chapter 1" section from `00-Preface.asciidoc` and paste it into a
    new file named `01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc`.
6.  Run `git add .`.
7.  Run `git commit --message 'Separate files.'`.
    The output should resemble:

.Separate file commit output
----
# git commit --message 'Separate files.'

[separate-files 4320fad] Separate files.
 3 files changed, 3 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 00-Preface.asciidoc
 create mode 100644 02-AdvancedGitInPractice.asciido
----

Now let's change the same file in the `master` branch.

1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git checkout master`.
3.  Edit `01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc` to add contents for Chapter 1.
4.  Run `git commit --message 'Add Chapter 1 content.'
    01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc`.
    The output should resemble:

.Chapter 1 content commit output
----
# git commit --message 'Add Chapter 1 content.'
  01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc

[master 7a04d8f] Add Chapter 1 content.
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
----

==== Problem
You wish to merge the `separate-files` branch into the `master` branch and
resolve the resulting merge conflict.

==== Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git checkout master`.
3.  Run `git merge separate-files`.
    The output should resemble:

.Merge with conflict output
----
# git merge separate-files

Auto-merging 01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc <1>
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in
  01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc <2>
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
----
<1> merge attempt
<2> merge conflict

From the merge with conflict output:

* "merge attempt (1)" shows Git attempting to find a way of solving the merge
  automatically using the default, recursive merge strategy.
* "merge conflict (2)" shows that the merge strategy was unable to
  automatically solve the merge conflict so it requires human intervention.

Now we need to edit `01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc` and solve then merge
conflict. When you open the file you will see something resembling:

.Before merge conflict resolution
----
== Chapter 1 <1>
<<<<<<< HEAD <2>
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single person in <3>
possession of good source code, must be in want of a version control
system.

== Chapter 2
// TODO: write two chapters
======= <4>
// TODO: think of funny first line that editor will approve. <5>
>>>>>>> separate-files <6>
----
//[DAN]:These annotations aren't good enough. I just don't understand what they mean. Incomng marker? Why does it say head? Which branch is it coming from? Branch separator? What if you're not dealing with another branch and it's jsut two people conflictng on the same branch? I think we need to grok this listing and the annotations need to give us that confidence we know what we're looking at here. Currently they don't
//[DAN]: Perhaps in further discussion of this listing, you could make a generalized listing with just the <<<  ==== >>> marks and a note saying what goes in between
<1> unchanged line
<2> incoming marker
<3> incoming line
<4> branch separator
<5> current version
<6> current marker

Recall this output from Chapter 2. We now need to edit the file so it has the
correct version. In this case this involves removing the Chapter 2 section as
it was moved to another file in the `separate-files` branch and use the new
Chapter 1 content that was entered in the `master` branch (here indicated by
the `HEAD` section).

After editing the file should resemble:

.After merge conflict resolution
----
== Chapter 1
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single person in
possession of good source code, must be in want of a version control
system.
----

Now the merge conflict has been resolved the merge conflict can be marked as
resolved with `git add` and then the merge commit committed.

1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git add 01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc`.
3.  Run `git commit`. Accept the default commit message.
    The output should resemble:

.Merge conflict commit output
----
[master 725c33a] Merge branch 'separate-files'
----

You can now run `git branch --delete separate-files` to delete the branch now
it's merged.

You have merged two branches and resolved a merge conflict.

==== Discussion
Merge commits have default commit message formats and slightly different diff output. Let's take a look at the merge commit by running `git show master`:

.Merge commit output
----
# git show master

//[DAN]: We need to annotate these two LHS columns of + and - in the listing. 
From the merge commit output:

* "merge subject (1)" shows the default commit message subject for merge
  commits. It specifies the incoming branch name. It can be changed but I
  prefer to leave it as-is and add any additional information in the commit
  message body instead so it is easily recognizable from subject alone as a
  merge commit.
* "conflicted file (2)" shows a file which had conflicts to be resolved
  manually. Sometimes these conflicts may be resolved incorrectly so this list
  is useful in spotting which files required resolution so they can be reviewed
  by other people later.
* "incoming delete (3)" shows a line that was deleted in the incoming (i.e.
  `separate-files`) branch's commit(s).
* "current delete (4)" shows a line that was deleted in the current (i.e.
  `master`) branch's commit(s).
* "current insert (5)" shows a line that was inserted in the current (i.e.
  `master`) branch's commit(s).

.Why are there two columns for +/- markers?
//[DAN]: Bring forward some of the code from the listing to illustrate here. Perhaps as a hedghog diagram so you id which column represents what.
NOTE: In this diff there are two columns (rather than the usual one) allocated
for `-` and `+` markers. This is because where a normal diff is just indicating
insertions and deletions to a file this _merge diff_ is showing insertions and
deletions to a file and the branch they were inserted or removed in. For
example, in the listing above the first column indicates a line inserted or
deleted from the incoming branch (i.e. `separate-files`) and the second column
indicates a line inserted or deleted from the current branch (i.e. `master`).

.Local repository after merge conflict resolution
image::screenshots/05-GitXMergeConflict.png[]
//[DAN]: As noted earlier, do you need the RHS of this diagram? Also, makig this a before and after diagram would work well here.
You can see from Figure 5.2 that the changes from both branches are visible in
the GitX output and that they are not always shown in chronological order; the
`Add Chapter 1 content` commit occurs before the `Separate files.` commit even
although it was made 3 minutes later.

===== Using a graphical merge tool
Instead of manually editing the contents of the file you can instead run `git
mergetool` which will run a graphical merge tool such as `emerge`, `gvimdiff`,
`kdiff3`, `meld`, `vimdiff`, `opendiff` or `tortoisemerge`.
//[DAN]: How is this configured? Should be a note here on how to set it up.
Sometimes it can be more helpful to use a graphical merge tool to be able to
visualize conflicts graphically and understand how they relate to the changes
that have been made by viewing them e.g. side-by-side. Although I personally
tend not to use these tools any more I found them useful when learning how to
use version control.

.Opendiff merge conflict resolution
image::screenshots/05-OpenDiff.png[] //[DAN]: Annotate this with how it works. Can it be shrunk at all so it's readable?

You can also customize the tool that is used to specify your own merge tools.
In Figure 5.3 you can see the `opendiff` tool provided with OSX used to resolve
the previous merge conflict.

Details for how to configure `git mergetool` to use your tool of choice are
available by running `git help mergetool`. //[DAN]:This should be a NOTE under the first para in the section.

=== Only resolve each merge conflict once: git rerere
You may find yourself in a situation where you have a long-running branch where
you have to keep merging in another branch and get the same merge conflicts
every time.

Git has a command named `git rerere` (which stands for Reuse Recorded
Resolution) which integrates with the normal `git merge` workflow to record the
resolution of merge conflicts for later replay. In short, you only need to
solve a particular merge conflict once.

Let's learn how to setup `git rerere`.

==== Problem
You wish to setup `git rerere` to integrate with the merge workflow so you
don't need to repeatedly resolve the same merges.

==== Solution //[DAN]: Markup a bit odd here in the listng...
1.  Run `git config --global --add rerere.enabled 1`.
    There will be no output.

You have enabled `git rerere` to automatically save and retrieve merge conflict
resolutions in all repositories.

==== Discussion
You do not need to run `git rerere manually` for it to store and retrieve merge
conflicts. After enabling `git rerere` you will see some slightly different
output the next time you run `git commit` after resolving a merge conflict:

.rerere merge conflict storage
----
# git commit

Recorded resolution for '01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc'. <1>
[master 725c33a] Merge branch 'separate-files'
----
<1> rerere storage

`git rerere` has been run by `git commit` to store the conflict and resolution
so it can recall the same resolution when it sees the same conflict.

If the same conflict is seen again:

.rerere merge conflict retrieval
----
# git merge separate-files

Auto-merging 01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in
  01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc
Resolved '01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc' using
  previous resolution. <1>
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
----
<1> rerere retrieval

`git rerere` has again been run by `git merge` to retrieve the resolution for
the identical conflict. You still need to run `git add` to accept the conflict
and can use `git diff` or edit the file to ensure the resolution was as
expected and desired.
//[DAN]: The para below should be a note or sidebar.
Sometimes you may wish to make `git rerere` forget a resolution for a
particular file because you resolved it incorrectly. In this case you can use
`git rerere` with a path to forget any resolutions for that file or directory.
For example to forget the resolution on `01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc`
above you would run `git rerere forget 01-IntroducingGitInPractice.asciidoc`.
There will be no output.

=== Create a tag: git tag
Recall from Chapter 2 that a tag is another _ref_ (or pointer) for a single
commit. Tags differ from branches in that they are (usually) permanent. Rather
than pointing to the work-in-progress on a feature they are generally used to
describe a version of a software project.

==== Problem
You wish to tag the current state of the `GitInPracticeRedux` `master` branch
as version `v0.1`.

==== Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git checkout master`.
3.  Run `git tag v0.1`. There will be no output.
4.  Run `git tag`. The output should resemble:

.tag listing output
----
# git tag

v0.1 <1>
----
<1> version tag //[DAN]: Will the output show all tags in the local repo or just in the current branch?

From the tag listing output:

* "version tag (1)" shows that there is a tag named `v0.1` in the local
  repository.

You have created a `v0.1` tag in the `GitInPracticeRedux` repository

==== Discussion
.Local repository after `git tag`
image::screenshots/05-GitXTag.png[]
//[DAN]: Same as other screenshots. Crop out teh RHS side if not needed and make it a before and after shot...

You can see from Figure 5.4 after the `git tag` there is a new `v0.1` ref on
the latest commit on the master branch (in the GitX interface this will be
yellow). This indicates that this commit has been tagged `v0.1`.

Note that, unlike branches, when new commits are made on the `master` branch
the `v0.1` tag will not change. This is why tags are useful for versioning; they
can record the significance of a particular commit without changing it.
//[DAN]: The next four paras might work better as a bulleted list 
You can list all the tags that match a given pattern by using the `--list` (or
`-l`) flag. For example the tag `v0.1` would be matched and listed by `git tag
list --v0.*`.

On rare occasions you may realise you have tagged the wrong commit. Tags can be
updated by passing the `--force` (or `-f`) flag to `git tag`. This will update
the tag to point to the new commit.

If you've created a tag with the wrong name rather than pointing to the wrong
commit you can delete it using the `--delete` (or `-d`) flag.

Run `git push` to push the `master` branch to `origin/master`. You may have
noticed that it did not push any of the tags. After you've tagged a version and
verified it is pointing to the correct commit and has the correct name then you
can push it using `git push --tags`. This will push all the tags you've created
in the local repository to the remote repository. These tags will then be
fetched by anyone using `git fetch` on the same repository in future.
//[DAN]: Perhaps the para below should be a sidebar or note? It seems pretty important to notice.
As you saw earlier it is possible to delete or modify tags locally. It's also
possible to push these changes to the remote repository with `git push --tags
--force` but this is not advised. For other users of the repository to have
their tags updated they will need to delete them locally and refetch. This is
intentionally cumbersome as Git intends tags to be static so does not change
them locally without users explicit intervention.

If you realize you've tagged the wrong commit and wish to update it after
pushing it's generally a better idea to just tag a new version and push that
instead.

=== Generate a version number based on previous tags: git describe
You've seen that `git tag` can be used to identify certain commits as released
versions of a project. In some cases you may wish to generate versions for the
software in between tags.

I'm a passionate advocate of continuous integration systems and I've worked on
desktop software projects with traditional semantic versioning (e.g. `1.0.0`).
//[DAN]: Is there a non-traditional method of semver?
On these projects I've setup continuous integration systems to create
installers of the software on every commit to the `master` branch. 
//[DAN]: Ths next sentence doesn't make any sense.
However,
this software there is an "About" screen which displays the version number of
the software. In this case I'd like to have a version number generated that
makes sense but does not rely on auto-generating a tag for each version of the
software.

As the expected version number would be `v0.1` given that has just been tagged
let's make another modification to the `GitInPracticeRedux` repository and
generate a version number for the new, untagged commit.

1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Add some content to the `00-Preface.asciidoc` file.
3.  Run `git commit --message 'Add preface text.' 00-Preface.asciidoc`.
    The output should resemble:

.Preface commit output
----
# git commit --message 'Add preface text.

[master 0a5e328] Add preface text.
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
----

==== Problem
You wish to generate a version number for a software project based on existing
tags in the repository.

==== Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git describe --tags`.
    The output should resemble:

.Tag describe output
----
# git describe --tags

v0.1-1-g0a5e328 <1>
----
<1> generated version

"generated version (1)" shows the version generated from the state based on
existing tags. It is hyphenated into three parts:

* `v0.1` is the the most recent tag on the current branch.
* `1` indicates that there has been one commit made since the most recent tag
  (`v0.1`) on the current branch.
* `g0a5e328` is the current commit SHA-1 prepended with a `g` (which stands for
  `git`).

You have generated a version number based on the existing tags in the
repository.

==== Discussion
If `git describe` is passed a ref then it will generate the version number for
that particular commit. For example, `git describe --tags v0.1` will output
`v0.1`.

If you wish to generate the long-form versions for tagged commits you can pass
the `--long` flag. For example, `git describe --tags --long v0.1` will output
`v0.1-0-g725c33a`.

If you wish to use a longer or shorter SHA-1 ref you can configure this using
the `--abbrev` flag. For example, `git describe --tags --abbrev=5` will output
`v0.1-1-g0a5e3`. Note that if you use very low values (e.g. `--abbrev=1`) then
`git describe` may use more than you have requested if it requires more to
uniquely identify a commit.

=== Add a single commit to the current branch: git cherry-pick
Sometimes you may wish to include only a single commit from a branch onto the
current branch rather than merging the entire branch. For example you may want
to back-port a single bug fix commit from a development branch into a stable
release branch. You could do this by manually creating the same change on that
branch but a better way would be using the tool that Git provides: `git
cherry-pick`.

Let's create a new branch based off the `v0.1` tag that we'll call
`v0.1-release` so we have something we can cherry-pick.

1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git checkout -b v0.1-release v0.1`
3.  Add some content to the `02-AdvancedGitInPractice.asciidoc` file.
4. Run `git commit --message 'Advanced practice technique.'
02-AdvancedGitInPractice.asciidoc`.
    The output should resemble:

.Release branch commit output
----
# git commit --message 'Advanced practice technique.'
    02-AdvancedGitInPractice.asciidoc

[v0.1-release dfe2377] Advanced practice technique.
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
----
//[DAN]: There are no annotations in the above code and yet the SHA-1 above seems to be the key to identifying which commit to cherry-pick. Also there is no reference to identifying \ using this SHA-1 in the text other than t note it changes post cherry-pick.
==== Problem
You wish to cherry-pick a commit from the `v0.1-release` branch to the `master`
branch.

==== Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git checkout master`.
3.  Run `git cherry-pick dfe2377`.
    The output should resemble:

.Commit cherry-pick output
----
# git cherry-pick dfe2377

[master c18c9ef] Advanced practice technique. <1>
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
----
<1> commit summary

The "commit summary (1)" shows the result of the cherry-pick operation. Note
that this is the same as the output for the previous `git commit` command with
one difference: the SHA-1 has changed.

.Why does the SHA-1 change on a cherry-pick?
NOTE: Recall that the SHA-1 of a commit is based on its tree and metadata
(which includes the parent commit SHA-1). As resulting `master` branch
cherry-picked commit has a difference parent to the commit that was
cherry-picked from the `v0.1-release` branch the commit SHA-1 differs also.

You have cherry-picked a commit from the `v0.1-release` branch to the `master`
branch.

==== Discussion
`git cherry-pick` (like many other Git commands) takes a ref as the parameter
rather than a specific commit. As a result we could have interchangeably used
`git cherry-pick v0.1-release` in the previous example for the same result.

You can pass multiple refs to `cherry-pick` and they will be cherry-picked onto
the current branch in the order requested.

.How many commits should I cherry pick?
NOTE: Cherry-picking is best used for individual commits that may be out of
sequence. The classic use-case highlighted earlier is back-porting bug fixes
from a development branch to a stable branch. When this is done it's
effectively duplicating the commits (rather than sharing them as with a merge).
If you find yourself wanting to cherry-pick the entire contents of a branch you
would be better to merge it instead.
//[DAN]: Again, a bulleted list here rather than plain paras would seem to be a better option.
If the `--edit` flag is passed to `git cherry-pick` it will prompt you for a
commit message before committing.

If there is a merge conflict on a `cherry-pick` you will need to resolve it a
similar fashion as a `git merge` (or the same fashion as `git rebase` which you
will see in Chapter 6). This involves resolving the conflict, running `git add`
but then `git cherry-pick --continue` instead of `git commit` to commit the
changes. If you wish to abort the current cherry-pick as perhaps you've
realised the merge-conflict is too complex you can do this using `git
cherry-pick --abort`.

If you are cherry-picking from a public branch (i.e. one you will push
remotely) to another public branch then you can use the `-x` flag to append a
line to the cherry-picked commit's message saying which commit this change was
picked from. For example if this flag was used in the last example the commit
message would have `(cherry picked from commit
dfe2377f00bb58b0f4ba5200b8f4299d0bfeeb5d)` appended to it.

When you want to indicate in the commit message which person cherry-picked a
particular change more explicitly than the "Committer" metadata that will be
set by default then you can use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) flag. This will
append a Signed-off-by line to the end of the commit message. For example if
this flag was used in the last example the commit message would have
`Signed-off-by: Mike McQuaid <mike@mikemcquaid.com>` appended to it.

=== Revert a previous commit: git revert
You may occasionally make a commit that you regret. You would then wish to undo
the commit until you can fix it so it works as intended.

In Git you can rewrite history to hide such mistakes (as we will learn in
Chapter 6) but this is generally considered bad practice if you have already
pushed a commit publicly. In these cases you are better to instead use `git
revert`.

==== Problem
You wish to revert a commit to reverse its changes.

==== Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git checkout master`.
3.  Run `git revert c18c9ef`. You will be prompted for a message. Accept the
    default.
    The output should resemble:

.Revert output
----
# git revert c18c9ef

[master 3e3c417] Revert "Advanced practice technique." <1>
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
----
<1> revert subject

To view the revert in more depth run `git show 3e3c417`:

.Revert show output
----
# git show 3e3c417

----

<2> revert message
<3> reversed diff

From the revert show output:

* "revert subject (1)" shows the reverted commit's subject prefixed with
  "Revert". This should hopefully describe what has been reverted fairly
  clearly and can be edited on commit if it does not.
* "revert message (2)" shows the body of the reverted commit which shows the
  full SHA-1 of the commit that was reverted.
* "reversed diff (3)" shows the diff of the new commit; this will be the exact
  opposite diff of the commit that was reverted.

You have reverted a commit to reverse its changes.

==== Discussion
`git revert` can take a `--signoff` (or `-s`) flag which behaves similarly to
that of `git cherry-pick`; it will append a Signed-off-by line to the end of
the commit message. For example if this flag was used in the last example the
commit message would have `Signed-off-by: Mike McQuaid <mike@mikemcquaid.com>`
appended to it.

=== List what branches contain a commit: git cherry
If you have a workflow in which you do not merge your commits to other branches
but have another person do it then you may wish to see which of your commits
has been merged to another branch. Git has a tool to do this: `git cherry`.

Let's make another commit on the `v0.1-release` branch first:

1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git checkout v0.1-release`
3.  Add some content to the `00-Preface.asciidoc` file.
4.  Run `git commit --message 'Add release preface.' 00-Preface.asciidoc`.
    The output should resemble:

.Release preface commit output
----
[v0.1-release a8200e1] Add release preface.
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
----

==== Problem
You wish to see what commits remain un-merged to the `master` branch from the
`v0.1-release` branch.

==== Solution
1.  Change to the directory containing your repository
    e.g. `cd /Users/mike/GitInPracticeRedux/`.
2.  Run `git checkout v0.1-release`.
3.  Run `git cherry --verbose master`
    The output should resemble:

.Cherry output
----
# git cherry --verbose master

- dfe2377f00bb58b0f4ba5200b8f4299d0bfeeb5d Advanced practice technique. <1>
+ a8200e1407d49e37baad47da04c0981f43d7c7ff Add release preface. <2>
----
<1> droppable commit
<2> kept commit

From the cherry output:

* "droppable commit (1)" is prefixed with a `-` and shows a commit that has
  been already included into the `master` branch.
* "kept commit (2)" is prefixed with a `+` and shows a commit that has not yet
  been included into the `master` branch.

You have seen which commits remain un-merged from the `master` branch.

==== Discussion
If you omit the `--verbose` (or `-v`) flag from `git cherry` it will show just
the `-`/`+` and the full SHA-1 but not the commit subject e.g. `-
dfe2377f00bb58b0f4ba5200b8f4299d0bfeeb5d`.

When you learn about rebasing in Chapter 6 `git cherry` can be useful at
showing what commits will be kept or dropped after a rebase operation.

=== Summary
In this chapter you hopefully learned:

* How to use `git merge`'s options to perform different types of merges
* How to use resolve merge conflicts
* How to use `git rerere` to repeatedly replay merge conflict resolutions
* How to use `git tag` to tag commits
* How to use `git describe` to generate version numbers for commits
* How to use `git cherry-pick` to bring individual commits from one branch to
  another
* How to use `git revert` to reverse individual commits
* How to use `git cherry` to list what commits remain un-merged on a branch

Now let's learn how to rewrite history.
